# TheHopPages

An application that contains a collection of pages that replace my information archive that's stored on my Google Drive.
The application shows the collection with files that can be viewed or edited/deleted (when the user is logged in ofcourse). 
Every file is stored in a category/subcategory and can be publicly visible or only behind a login.
The pages will be stored as .md files in the server directory. That way there is no backend with a database needed.
